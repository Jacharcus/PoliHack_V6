### Breeds recognition Training model


## My thought process

- using Google's Inception training model for images recognition
(pretrained image classificaton with over 100.000 images)

- fine tune the existing model with Standford's Dogs Dataset (20.000 images with over
120 breeds), basically ataching a new classification layer with the dog breeds =>
